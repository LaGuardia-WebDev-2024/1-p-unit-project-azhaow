    <h3> 📸 PHOTOGRAPHY 📸 </h3>
    <p> I love taking photos and videos! Especially of scenic views. I usually just use my phone but I also have a digital camera <em> (Instax Mini Evo)</em>. I'd really want a professional camera of somesort to take higher quality videos and pictures, but I'm too broke (╥﹏╥)o
